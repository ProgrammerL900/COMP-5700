Question 1
Why C programming language is believed to weak in security features?
  No boundary checks 
  No overflow checks 
  Static typing but with loopholes 
  No automatic memory management 
 
Question 2
Why C programming language is still widely used today?
  Backwards-compatibility for legacy systems 
  Performance reasons 
 
Question 3
Consider the following simple program:

#include <string.h>

  strcpy(buf, argv[1]);
  return;
}
Is it possible to overflow? Where?
  Yes. On the stack

Fuzzing can be categorized into the following classes:
  Grey-box fuzzing 
  Black-box fuzzing 
  White-box fuzzing 
 
Question 9
The right order of attacks in history:
  Code injection attacks, then code reuse attacks 
 
Question 10
