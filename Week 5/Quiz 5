Question 1
To analyze binary code, extra code can be instrumented either statically or dynamically.
True

Question 2
By dynamic binary analysis, the ``dynamic'' here means: 
analyzing by running the program

Question 3
Software tool examples of dynamic binary instrumentation are:
Valgrind 
QEMU
Pin

Question 4
Intel Pin tools usually have two kinds of routines:
analysis routines
Instrumentation routines

Question 5
Intel Pin tools can not only launch and instrument an application but also can attach to a running process and instrument that application.
True

Question 6
While of the followings is/are true?
The Pin tool prints out ech instruction runtime address
The Pin tool instruments at the program point before eac instruction

Question 7
While of the followings is/are true?
The Pin tool prints out each instruction address to a file 
PIN_Init initializes the Pin framework

Question 8
While function is the instrumentation routine and which is the analysis routine?
Instruction function is the instrumentation routine
printip function is the analysis routine

Question 9
To attach to process with process id 2345 using a Pin tool of mytool.so, the command is:
$/my/dir/pin -t 
mytool.so

 -
pid

 2345

Question 10
Which of the followings is/are correct about this example Pin tool?
  This Pin tool prints out total instruction count executed
